# Instructions 


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your  \texttt{R} code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

**NOTE**: YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE `install.packages` IN YOUR CODE; OTHERWISE, THE `Knit` OPTION WILL GIVE AN ERROR. COMMENT OUT ALL PACKAGE INSTALLATIONS.

Submit **both**  the `rmd` and generated `output` files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction. PDF or HTML is preferred. 

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(3, 5, \dots, 29)$.

```{r}
seq(3, 30, 2)
seq(3, 29, 2)
```



# Question 1 [30 Pts]

## Q1a (10 points) 

Suppose you have a dataset with two variables, age (c(41, 56, 45, 65, 25, 70, 30, 33, 60, 35)) and income (c(93000, 110000, 80000, 125000, 40000, 145000, 78000, 51000, 110000, 69000)), for a sample of 10 individuals. The `age` variable represents the age of the individual, while the `income` variable represents their annual income. Set variables age and income respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the `age` to the `income`. 

Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons for your answer as a comment.
```{r}
age <- c(41, 56, 45, 65, 25, 70, 30, 33, 60, 35)
income <- c(93000, 110000, 80000, 125000, 40000, 145000, 78000, 51000, 110000, 69000)
dataset <- data.frame(age,income)
dataset
model <- lm(income ~ age,data=dataset)
model 
summary(model)
#######Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? 

#Income = -835.0 + 1976.8 * age
###This linear regression model shows a positive relationship between age and income. The coefficient for age is estimated to be 1976.8, meaning that for every one-year increase in age, income increases by $1,976.8 so age is a significant predictor of income. The intercept of this model is -835.0.  In the context of the data, a negative intercept of -835 implies that income is negative for newborns and people at age 0.This model assumes a linear relationship between income and age, which might not be appropriate in every case.It is important  to consider additional factors that may affect the relationship between age and income.


```

## Q1b (10 points) 
Plot the income as a function of age using a scatterplot and draw the least-square line on the same plot. 
```{r}
plot(age,income, pch=15,
xlab="age",
ylab="income",
main="age of individuals and income")
abline(coefficients(model), lwd=3, lty=3, col="pink")



```

## Q1c (10 points) 
Use the regression line to predict the income when the age is 38. 
```{r}
age_predict <-38
#income_predict<- intercept+slope*age_predict
#income_predict

income_predict<- -835.00+1976.8*38
income_predict



```



# Question 2 [45 Pts]

Please load the OpenIntro Statistics Dataset - loans_full_schema data by running the following chunk of code.

You can read more about at this link:
   - https://r-data.pmagunia.com/dataset/openintro-statistics-dataset-loansfullschema
   - https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loans_full_schema
```{r load_data}
OpenIntro = read.csv("https://r-data.pmagunia.com/system/files/datasets/dataset-100644960.csv")

```

## Q2a (5 points) 
Display the first 5 rows of the `OpenIntro` data, the names of all the variables, and a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}

head(OpenIntro, n=5)

# Print the names of all the variables
 names(OpenIntro)

# Print a descriptive summary of each variable
 summary(OpenIntro)


```


## Q2b-1 (10 points) 
Use annual income (`annual_income`), the length of the loan (`term`), interest rate (`interest_rate`), and loan ammount (`loan_amount`) to build a linear regression model to predict Monthly payment for the loan the applicant received. (`installment`).  


#   The formula is :
  
  installment = intercept + (coefficient_loan_amount * loan_amount) + (coefficient_term* term) + (coefficient_interest_rate * interest_rate) + (coefficient_annual_income * annual_income)


#   The model in R:

model <- lm(installment ~ annual_income + term + interest_rate + loan_amount, data=OpenIntro)
 
model




## Q2b-2 (5 points) 
How can you draw a conclusion from the results? 
   (Note: Full marks requires comment on the predictors)
```{r}
model <- lm(installment ~ annual_income + term + interest_rate + loan_amount, data=OpenIntro)
 
model

#installment = intercept + (coefficient_loan_amount * loan_amount) + (coefficient_term* term) + (coefficient_interest_rate * interest_rate) + (coefficient_annual_income * annual_income)

#So in this case, all four predictors have p-values < 0.05, indicating that they are statistically significant predictors of installment.


```

## Q2c (10 points) 

Based on the output of your model, write an equation using the intercept and coefficients of `loan_amount`, `term`, `interest_rate`, and `annual_income`. Then, use the equation for a case with `loan_amount` of 24000, `term` of 36, `interest_rate` of 6.72, and `annual_income` of 90000 to predict their `installment`.  You are not allowed to use `predict` function for this task.

```{r}

installment = -273.94 + (0.0948 * 24000) + (24.72 * 36) + (24.38 * 6.72) + (0.0021 * 90000)
#installment = $507.15

```

## Q2d-1 (10 points) 
Display the correlation matrix of the following variables: 
- installment (`installment`), 
- loan amount (`loan_amount`),
- salary (`annual_income`),
- term (`term`),
- total credit limit (`total_credit_limit`). 


OpenIntro = read.csv("https://r-data.pmagunia.com/system/files/datasets/dataset-100644960.csv")

# Select the variables
vars <- c("installment", "loan_amount", "annual_income", "term", "total_credit_limit")
data <- OpenIntro[vars]

# correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(data)

# Display the correlation matrix
print(cor_matrix)



## Q2d-2 (5 points) 
Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments. 
   (answer not included, Please grade on student's comments)
```{r}
OpenIntro = read.csv("https://r-data.pmagunia.com/system/files/datasets/dataset-100644960.csv")

# Select the variables
vars <- c("installment", "loan_amount", "annual_income", "term", "total_credit_limit")
data <- OpenIntro[vars]

# correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(data)

# Display the correlation matrix
print(cor_matrix)


#here we see that the installment and loan_amount variables have a very strong positive correlation (0.95), which makes sense since larger loans will generally have larger payments. The annual_income and total_credit_limit variables also have a moderate positive correlation (0.78), which makes sense since people with higher incomes may be approved for higher credit limits. The other variables have weaker correlations with each other.
 


```



## Question 3 [25 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


## Q3a (10 points) 
Use a histogram with `20` breaks to assess the normality of the `Temp` variable, then explain why it appears (to some extent) normally distributed. 
```{r}
library(ISwR)
data(airquality)
# Create a histogram of the Temp variable with 20 breaks
hist(airquality$Temp, breaks = 20)

##To explain why it appears (to some extent) normally distributed, we can look at the histogram shape. The histogram appears roughly symmetrical, with a bell-shaped curve, which is characteristic of a normal distribution. Additionally, the histogram has no apparent outliers or skewness, which indicates normality.



```

## Q3b (15 points) 
Create a comparison boxplot that shows the distribution of `Wind` in each month. Use different colours for each month. 

```{r}

# in order to create a comparison boxplot that shows the distribution of Wind in each month,I  used the ggplot2 package 

library(ggplot2)

# create the boxplot

ggplot(airquality, aes(x = factor(Month), y = Wind, fill = factor(Month))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Wind (mph)") +
  theme_bw()

```
